  reference: "I've worked with Michael twice now.  In both cases, Michael was considered\
    \ to be one of the most skilled and learned developers in those software development\
    \ companies.\r\n\r\nIn the time I've known him, Michael has only delivered high-quality\
    \ code across at least four languages, but also was instrumental in improving\
    \ the team's knowledge of how to get the best code out of those languages.\r\n\
    \r\nMichael is dedicated to knowing as much as he can about how to develop software\
    \ properly, from both a technical and management point of view, and in teaching\
    \ others how to do the same."
- name: Brad Shuttleworth
  reference: Michael is an absolutely dedicated, very well rounded developer.  He
    managed to guide me into the professional development world while at the same
    time starting on the same footing in terms of Zope/Plone experience.  His broad
    understanding of the issues and complexities of development projects meant that
    he could provide extremely high quality solutions, even while his specific skills
    in the technology at hand were very basic.
