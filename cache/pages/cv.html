<h2>Self-Summary</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Michael, Michael Joseph (yes, two first names, I know. MJ works as
an internet handle, for people not into the whole brevity thing and
disambiguation purposes).</p>
<p>I have worked in the computer / internet industry for the last 14 years,
primarily as a backend software engineer for web applications.</p>
<p>I have seen enough technology pass through the mill to be fairly agnostic
across all the usual religious divides (programming language, editor,
tabs vs spaces (ok, wait, scratch the last one, I <em>am</em> zealous about
whitespace)). I play extremely well with others, but I also <em>need</em> to have
<em>some</em> solo time.</p>
<p>I can write, read, review, edit and correct
(in order of preference and experience):</p>
<ul>
<li>English</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Bash + GNU</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Javascript, Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been the technology lead of small developer teams (max 5), providing
technical leadership and engineering management roles.</p>
<p>I spoke at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1i-louid4M">PyconZA 2013</a>
about the work we did at <a href="https://www.yola.com">Yola</a> during my time there.</p>
