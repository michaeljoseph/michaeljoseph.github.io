<p>Time slows as they twist around each other. The steel tipped arrow of
time, spikes them together, through their hearts. Their oscillations steady and

<p>That they are the same.</p>
<p>And one.</p>
<p>They collide. Messily. Squelching bodily fluids over their carefully curated

<p>They gather the fragile life between them, sheltering it from the world.</p>
<p>This, then, was the perfection they sought.</p>
