<p>To effectively exist in the world, we <em>must</em> take some things for granted.</p>
<p>If we did not, we would sink into the quicksand of endless possibility.</p>
<p>Since we are constrained by our finite faculties, we have to <em>choose</em> what we spend our limited attention on.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter <em>what</em> you believe in, what the story you tell yourself is, as long as you don't have to consciously
think about it. Your set of stories don't even need mutual consistency.</p>
<p>In fact, <em>any</em> set of stories becomes plausible, given the frame of reference that manifests it (the beliefs that your
environment generates, the fabric you exist in).</p>
<p>And so, if you're able to alter your perspective sufficiently (the lens that you look through), you can believe in
<strong>anything</strong>. And <strong>everything</strong>.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>Yourself.</p>
<p>Like I do.</p>
<p>The only thing we truly have is ourselves.</p>
<p>It's all just you. Me. Us.</p>
<p>So let's stop fighting over what we believe? Ok?</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
