<h2>The Assertion</h2>
<p>The quantum mechanical understanding of the universe is a sufficient metaphysical explanation of the
perceived human condition.</p>
<h2>Birth And Death</h2>
<p>We seek religion because we fear death.</p>
<p>Because we cannot conceive that we may cease to be, since conception requires a container. 
We can't see out of ourselves, theorizes <a href="http://deoxy.org/w_nature.htm">Alan Watts</a>, because when we see the world, the act of seeing,
creates the appropriate and opposing reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A world without eyes means that the sun is not light, the way beating a skinless drum makes no sound</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(the answer to the eternal question of what happened alone in the woods)</p>
<p>We live in and are continuous with the environment. </p>
<p>Quantum mechanics lays bare the essential nature of matter (as deep as our microscopes can scan and as minute as our
particle accelerators can splice) as in a continuous state of potential.
Life is the dual probabilistic nature of constantly shifting quantum particles in a tumbling waveform.</p>
<p>The basis of the physics is the quantum. The inseparable unit of [attention][] that we transmit when we perceive or measure.</p>
<h2>The History And Evolution Of Metaphysics</h2>
<p>First the [ceramic model][], then the [fully automatic model][], and now: the organic [evolutionary model][] and the
[dramatic metaphysical model][].</p>
<p>All the world's a screen and we are merely passing trailers.
Or summer feel good hits.
Or an eternally syndicated show.
Maybe we're SNL?</p>
