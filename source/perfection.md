# perfection

Perfection (of a kind) was the measure they held their love up to.
Hoisting their emotional flagpoles to raise the aesthetic tent of
their tasteful, by-the-book-and-numbers life.

Just the right (tasteful) amount of everything(hell to shop for, the gift cards lie dusty
in the bottom shelf)

They emerge (blinking), one day, many years later, gasping for breath.
Finding theselves slowly suffocating in the vacuum of their edifice.

She tired first. Let her pole sag.
