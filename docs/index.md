## Michael Joseph

![avatar](media/shaggy.svg){ align=left height=200px width=200px }

I've [worked](/resume) in the computer / internet industry for the last {{ now().year - 1999}} years, primarily as a backend software engineer for web applications.

For most of that time, I've either been the lead of a small developer team or provided technical leadership and engineering management roles.

*[Michael Joseph]: yes, two first names, I know. MJ works as an internet handle, for people into the whole brevity thing as well as for disambiguation purpose
