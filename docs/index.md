Hi, I'm Michael, Michael Joseph (yes, two first names, I know. MJ works as
an internet handle, for people into the whole brevity thing as well as for
disambiguation purposes).

I have worked in the computer / internet industry for the last 14 years,
primarily as a backend software engineer for web applications.

I have seen enough technology pass through the mill to be fairly agnostic
across all the usual religious divides (programming language, editor,
tabs vs spaces (ok, wait, scratch the last one, I _am_ zealous about
whitespace)). I play extremely well with others, but I also _need_ to have
*some* solo time.

I can write, read and review (in order of preference and experience):

- English
- Python
- Bash + GNU
- Ruby
- Java
- PHP
- Javascript

I've been the technology lead of small developer teams (max 5), providing
technical leadership and engineering management roles.

I spoke at [PyconZA 2013](https://archive.org/details/pyconza2013-app-to-platform)
about the work we did at [Yola](https://www.yola.com) during my time there, and
at [PyconZA 2014](https://archive.org/details/pyconza2014-cookie-monster) about becoming a contributor to an Open Source project.
