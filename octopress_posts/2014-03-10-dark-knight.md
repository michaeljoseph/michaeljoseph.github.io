{% blockquote %}
I'm a dog chasing cars... I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.
I just do things.  I'm just the wrench in the gears. I hate plans.
Yours, theirs, everyone's.  Maroni has plans.  Gordon has plans.
Schemers trying to control their worlds.

THE JOKER (CONT'D)
Introduce a little anarchy, you upset 
established order and everything 
becomes chaos.  I'm an agent of chaos.  
And you know the thing about chaos, 
Harvey?
