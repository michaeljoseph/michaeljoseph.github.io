## The Assertion

The quantum mechanical understanding of the universe is a sufficient metaphysical explanation of the
perceived human condition.

## Birth And Death

We seek religion because we fear death.

Because we cannot conceive that we may cease to be, since conception requires a container. 
We can't see out of ourselves, theorizes [Alan Watts][], because when we see the world, the act of seeing,
creates the appropriate and opposing reality.

> A world without eyes means that the sun is not light, the way beating a skinless drum makes no sound

(the answer to the eternal question of what happened alone in the woods)

We live in and are continuous with the environment. 

Quantum mechanics lays bare the essential nature of matter (as deep as our microscopes can scan and as minute as our
particle accelerators can splice) as in a continuous state of potential.
Life is the dual probabilistic nature of constantly shifting quantum particles in a tumbling waveform.

The basis of the physics is the quantum. The inseparable unit of [attention][] that we transmit when we perceive or measure.

## The History And Evolution Of Metaphysics

First the [ceramic model][], then the [fully automatic model][], and now: the organic [evolutionary model][] and the
[dramatic metaphysical model][].

All the world's a screen and we are merely passing trailers.
Or summer feel good hits.
Or an eternally syndicated show.
Maybe we're SNL?
