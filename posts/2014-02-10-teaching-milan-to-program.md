## core concepts
### variables
- a variable is like a cardboard box. you can put [things](#data-types) into it
  and then use the variable like it was the thing inside it
  algebra: x
### data-types
- string = "a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes"
- int = 4 # An [integer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)
{% blockquote %}
An integer is a number that can be written without a fractional or decimal component.
For example, 21, 4, and −2048 are integers; 9.75, 5½, and √2 are not integers.
{% endblockquote %}

## Milan's Game Idea

### Name: TODO

### Description

Set in Cartoon Network and Disney Land: all the villains from all the TV shows have escaped
into other shows (kind of like Wreck It Ralph, but with Cartoon Network and Disney characters)

### Game Play

Travel through time and stop the villains from invading the whole world.
Once they've conquered the TV world, they will have access to the real world.
The only way to stop them is to team up with (all) the characters from different
shows.

Control your character with the arrow keys or the mouse.
Talk to other players (voice and text)
Form teams with other players

Suit up: store that you can buy upgrades and items from [$$$$$]
- weapons
- armor
- special items

Find clues and codes to travel to different worlds

### Characters

#### Heroes

- Finn The Human
- Jake The Dog

#### Villains

- The Lich
- Vilgax
- Clu
