To effectively exist in the world, we _must_ take some things for granted.

If we did not, we would sink into the quicksand of endless possibility.

Since we are constrained by our finite faculties, we have to _choose_ what we spend our limited attention on.

It doesn't matter _what_ you believe in, what the story you tell yourself is, as long as you don't have to consciously
think about it. Your set of stories don't even need mutual consistency.

In fact, _any_ set of stories becomes plausible, given the frame of reference that manifests it (the beliefs that your
environment generates, the fabric you exist in).

And so, if you're able to alter your perspective sufficiently (the lens that you look through), you can believe in
**anything**. And **everything**.

Everybody.

Yourself.

Like I do.

The only thing we truly have is ourselves.

It's all just you. Me. Us.

So let's stop fighting over what we believe? Ok?

Cool.
