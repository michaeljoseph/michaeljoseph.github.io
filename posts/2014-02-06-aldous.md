# poetic reply
aldous huxley was a dick
his mother called him richard

he wrote a book
i thought it good
brave new world was right?

so, darling dear
i sadly fear
your meaning isn't clear


he seems alright?
i mean: brave new world

# limerick
aldous huxley was a dick
his mother called him richard
and when he wasn't taking drugs
he wrote a lot about them
