# The Moon Song

![yyy](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Yeah_Yeah_Yeahs.jpg)

{% blockquote The Moon Song: Karen O %}
I'm lying on the moon
My dear, I'll be there soon
It's a quiet starry place
Time's we're swallowed up
In space we're here a million miles away
{% endblockquote %}

# Off You

![kim-deal](http://www.efeeme.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-deal-18-06-13.jpg)

{% blockquote Off You: The Breeders %}
I've laid this island sun a thousand times
I'm on it but I'm going strange

This island's sun I've laid a thousand times
Fortune me, fortune me, of all of my mistakes
I think I lent you late, now every sick person
Seemed to come my way

But I've never seen the scarlet
Or a riot or the violence of you
I am the autumn in the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes
{% endblockquote %}
