> I'm lying on the moon
> My dear, I'll be there soon
> It's a quiet starry place
> Time's we're swallowed up
> In space we're here a million miles away

>I've laid this island sun a thousand times
I'm on it but I'm going strange

> This island's sun I've laid a thousand times
Fortune me, fortune me, of all of my mistakes
I think I lent you late, now every sick person
Seemed to come my way

> But I've never seen the scarlet
Or a riot or the violence of you
I am the autumn in the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes
