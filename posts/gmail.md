If you don't know your gmail address, I get to reset your password and mess with your pathetic life on
your horribly designed, low-rent dating website (some fucken Designed for IE 6 type shit. My internet
nerds are feeling me on that. no. doubt. or diggity. why, yes, i do like to ).
Just remember who started it.
You'll definitely remember who ends it.
Send me an email if you require further explanation.
Oh wait, that's right. You can't.
