[Attention is the quantum][] that precipitates the collapse of the [waveform][].

So, [eyeballs][] can [kill cats][].

If we then apply [Bell's Theorem][], which I'm going to restate as: 

> Remote eyeballs affect our local reality

Then:

## Eyeballs kill remote cats.

So, use your attention wisely.
