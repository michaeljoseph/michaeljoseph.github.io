# Open Source At Yola

At [Yola], using and creating [free and open source software][] has been part
of our engineering DNA since we started on this crazy adventure 7 years
(to the month!) ago.

***
Since our inception, we've been conscious about the importance F/of Open Source
software to 
one of our stated technology architecture goals 
the importance of [F/OSS][] software to [Yola][]:
***

{% blockquote %}
Open Source solutions are preferable to proprietary ones
{% endblockquote %}

Unsurprisingly, many, if not all of our engineers (note to self: conduct an
open source witch-hunt later) are opensource contributors. And large and
essential pieces of our technology stacks (personal and for profit) rely on
most of the major F/OSS software projects (Apache, MySQL, PHP, Python, Java,
GNU/Linux, Memcached).

This is our first attempt to consciously sling some love back into
the community of generous people that have made my lifestyle possible.

And, so that the shoulders of the giants our children stand on, will already
be poking into the technological stratosphere (#technologicalsignularity)

I volunteered (jk, Stacey made me...) to break the ice, lead the charge and
mix the metaphors (and the drinks), because I have some level of skill in
the perpetuation of cliches, the contruction of meta-mountains from anthills.
Consider me the unpaid opening act for the imminent prose and code performances
of the rest of our talented and well-groomed engineering team.

I get to show off some of the projects that we're proudest of:

- [demands][] is a exceptionally demanding HTTP client framework built on [requests][]

- [authtkt][] implements the authtkt apache something protocol whatever

- [property-cache][] caches properties

You can find the rest of our public projects [here][]. Please try them out, use them and help us improve them.

We also maintain some interesting personal projects:

-[@thomasw]
  - testtube
  - djproxy

- [@michaeljoseph]
  - changes


Don't be strangers.
